Progress
-------
Working examples:
y01 - launch chrome
y02 - .arjuna_option(firefox details)
y03 - .firefox()
y04 - firefox based on project conf
y05 - headless chrome, extended driver config
y06 -> getting arjuna property from project conf using a.b.c and A_B_C and as_* value methods.
y07 -> programmatic user options
y08 -> user options from project config
y09 -> basic identifiers. link_ptext needs to be fixed.
y10 -> xpath examples
y11 -> css examples
y12 -> Extended identifiers work (which are not commented in example code.)
y13 -> OR relationship works
y14 -> HardCoded.sleep works
y15 -> Basic element interactions work.
y16 -> auto finding and state checking works for basic interactions.
y17 -> multielement works.
y18 -> Java script execution works
y19 -> alerts work
y20 -> Basic window handling works
y21 -> Window with title, partial title and content locator works. check notes for the found issue.
y22 -> Frame handling works.
y23 -> Dropdown works. (Performance is slow. investigate.)
y24 -> RadioGroup logic works.
y25 -> Named arg formatting, case-insensitive works.
y26 -> With.javascript works as expected for success and failure scenarios (single element)
y27 -> With.javascript works as expected for success and failure scenarios (multi element)
y28 -> Pre state check works for basic element.
y29 -> Dropdown pre state check off works.
y30 -> custom dropdown works (example - Bootstrap dropdown control)
y31 -> Needs work on Narada side for suitable example controls
y32 -> All source retrieval works.

GNS
- Simple app abstraction - Done
- Simple GOM - Done
- Composite GOM - Done
- Single context GNS. Make it the default. - Done
- Check parameterization for identifier pulled from GNS - Done

Action Chains (In progress)
---------------------------
- As of now introducing the following actions without explicit action chain creation:
    GuiElement methods
        - hover
        - hover_and_click

Fine Tuning
-----------
Done
- User defined options can be provided as any enum constant. 
- User defined options can be provided as any enum constant.
- Concept of lenient interaction introduced
    - It is observed that although selenium returns is clickable true, element may yet not be clickable.
    - Arjuna post checking clickability, also executes lenient clicking.
Pending
- In the CGOM example, introduce loc enum in page
- In example code introduce user defined option as enum
- Change element names to valid python names.
- Normalise element names so that _ and - can be used interchangeably. 
    Replace with space in storing and retrieving.
- Introduce 'hold' method in Gui interaction components. It should wait for enter key. input("Press enter to continue")

Next Features on Priority
-------------------------
- ActionChains
- unittest core support -> HtmlRunner, Test Suite building.
- WebDriverManager
- Support for loading conf from a file. E.g. env based multiple conf files.
- Make wait configurable on a per element level. Configure method.

GNS Desirables
---------------
- Introduce equivalent of LoadableComponent logic.
- Extract with mechanism for pages and separate from the generic logic. It is getting too complicated.
- An identifier should explicitly look for parameter value:
    - $kw.abc$ -> This should directly come from With.format() provided keywords.
    - $dd.abc$ -> This should come from data that is provided to the test.
    - $l10n.abc$ -> This should come from localizer.
    - $conf.abc$ -> This should come from config attached to the automator for which this namespace is loaded.
    - $abc$ -> This will be the least performing but should work. 
        This should auto look up in the above sequence.

    - Introduce a configuration option where the lookup order can be configured.
    - There should be a provision where a certain lookup can be completely switched off.
        E.g. if there is no localizer then that should not be there in the lookup object.
    - One thought is that you can create a Intrapolator class for this.
        Each GuiDef can have an intrapolator object attached to it.

Check support for OR AND parameterized identifiers

Localizer
---------
Add localizer

Deferred and Reason
-------------------
Concept of Intent and Expression.
Intent is what a test wants to do -> typically it should talk business.
Expression is technical implementation -> e.g. ExpressViaWebUI. ExpressViaMobileUI. ExpressViaWebSvc. ExpressViaDB.

Notes for any needed fixes and changes
-------------------------------------
Names of CLI options to be changed to baseline and extended
CLI ->
aro
uro
aeo
ueo

1. Arjuna identifiers:
- Add support for new identifiers.

2. With.CLASS_NAMES --> Shouldn't we have just one identifier. instead of 2
- remove With.CLASS_NAME?

3. Setu Log is being created - get rid.
4. arjuna-py.log --> rename to arjuna.log
5. include timestamp for arjuna log.

6. Test when different values in sample code are provided as Values rather than as_* conversion.
    The errors should tell -> expecting str/int etc instead of AnyRefValue.
    OR those methods at the correct layer should convert it to the expected value type and use.

7. JS execution works and because of local exec can return objects as well. 
    - should evaluate whether return this object as AnyRefValue makes sense?

8. Window handling logic needs to be checked for stability with content locator. 
    Wait time should be overall wait time. Needs to be checked.
    Also check open windows at any point in time.
    May be we should check for window readiness and page load when a new window is launched using JavaScript.

9. Look at dropdown logic in terms of number of inquiries sent to the browser
    With XML parsing in place. It should be very quick. 
    Evaluate.

10. Create Arjuna Named Exceptions:
    - The exception from the tool or other relevant exceptions should be seen in the dig deeper details.
    - Element Finding -> IdentificationError
    - With.JS: Description should mention about the problem.
    - 

11. Text case insensitive? by default off. For on more processing is needed so expectation should be set accordingly.

12. Check the dispatcher object in case of select control for options. is it set to automator or element.

Planned Features
Element Configuration (code and gns)
    - Support at automator level.
    - Support at configuration level
Advanced Frame related functionality - In Progress
    - Enumerating immediate frames at Dom Root and Frame level
    - Content based frame finding for immediate child frames
Action Chains - Named method for common interactions - In progress
    - Invoker-side interfaces and classes - Mostly done
    - Impl and dispatcher pending
    - Look for Pythonic opportunities in Invoker api
Nested Elements support
More waits
    wait for Absence, Invisible and Disabled

 - Create a a method in Gui and GuiAutomator, it should also be able to take a callable and its args. Possibly for recording option to be run in a second thread. launch a tool, whatever.

Map valid With options to tpye of component. Clear exceptions with troubleshooting to be coded.
Explicit wait in Arjuna Setu for Frames and Windows, which works under the total limit of gui max wait.
Classification of Errors and Exceptions
Single Context GNS
    Should be the default context
Element configuration support in GNS
AND relationship for code and gns
Option to enable proxy in Selenium dispatcher
Taking screenshot - automator level, rect, element, elements
Frame config: should be able to change the iframe to e.g. object. Enumerate frames should take an optional argument of With and do a multielement match instead of the default With.INDEX used internally.
File based configuration load_from_code_file
    coded
    pytest or unitee session file should support this
    CLI
Add support for envioronment variables to be consumed in configuration
Overridabiliy and visibility of configuration options ---> This needs to be implemented before CLI can be discussed: Following are the levels for which it should be clearly defined. Preferrably all configuration settings should be documented as matrix with the mapping:
    Project.conf
    Programmatic
    CLI - Reference
    CLI - Extended
Data Reference

What SetuSvc used to do:

    def __register_test_session(self, root_dir, cliConfig=None):
        handler = TestSessionHandler()

        config = handler.init(root_dir, cliConfig)
        SetuSvcObjectManager.register_testsession_handler(handler)
        out = {
            'testSessionSetuId': handler.setu_id,
            'configSetuId': config.setu_id,

        }

        out.update(config.as_json_dict())
        return out

    def _handle_configurator_action(self, ts_handler, action_type, json_args):
        return ts_handler.conf_handler.take_action(action_type.name, json_args)

    def _handle_data_source_action(self, ts_handler, action_type, json_args):
        return ts_handler.datasource_handler.take_action(action_type, json_args)

    def _handle_gui_automator_action(self, ts_handler, action_type, json_args):
        if action_type == GuiAutoActionType.LAUNCH:
            config = ts_handler.conf_handler.configurator.get_config(Handler.get_config_setuid(json_args))
            automator_handler = GuiAutomatorHandler(ts_handler.dispatcher)
            automator_handler.launch_automator(config, **json_args)
            ts_handler.register_gui_automator_handler(automator_handler)
            return {'automatorSetuId' : automator_handler.setu_id}
        elif action_type == GuiAutoActionType.QUIT:
            handler = ts_handler.get_automator_handler(json_args)
            handler.quit_automator()
            ts_handler.deregister_gui_automator_handler(handler) 
        else:
            gui_setu_id = json_args.get("guiSetuId", None)
            handler = None
            if gui_setu_id is not None:
                handler = ts_handler.get_gui_handler(json_args)
            else:
                gui_automator_setu_id = json_args.get("automatorSetuId", None)
                if gui_automator_setu_id is None:
                    raise Exception("For gui component action either guiSetuId or automatorSetuId must be provided.")
                handler = ts_handler.get_automator_handler(json_args)
            return handler.take_action(action_type, json_args)

    def _handle_gui_action(self, ts_handler, action_type, json_args):
        automator_handler = ts_handler.get_automator_handler(json_args)
        return ts_handler.gui_manager.take_action(automator_handler, action_type, json_args)


You need to see the following in relation to With object which is now directly used
in client API instead of a web service call:

    def define_element(self, locators):
        elem = self.automator.create_element(GuiElementMetaData.createEMD(locators))
        return {"guiComponentSetuId" : elem.setu_id}

    def define_element_with_emd(self, emd):
        elem = self.automator.create_element(emd)
        return {"guiComponentSetuId" : elem.setu_id}

Also look at the following take element action api:

    def take_element_action(self, action, json_dict):
        elem_setu_id = self.get_element_setuid(json_dict)
        self.automator.slomo()
        instance_action = False
        if "isInstanceAction" in json_dict:
            instance_action = json_dict["isInstanceAction"]
            del json_dict["isInstanceAction"]
        if instance_action:
            index = json_dict["instanceIndex"]
            del json_dict["instanceIndex"]
            multi_element =  self.automator.get_multielement_for_setu_id(elem_setu_id)
            element = multi_element.get_instance_at_index(index)
        else:
            element =  self.automator.get_element_for_setu_id(elem_setu_id)
        return getattr(ElementHandler, action)(element, **json_dict)

Evaluate the following drop down methods:
class DropdownHandler:
    @classmethod
    def configure(cls, dropdown, elementConfig):
        dropdown.configure(elementConfig)

    @classmethod
    def set_option_locators(cls, dropdown, locators):
        dropdown.set_option_locators(GuiElementMetaData.createEMD(locators))

    @classmethod
    def set_option_container(cls, dropdown, locators):
        dropdown.set_option_container(GuiElementMetaData.createEMD(locators))

Following window method:
    @classmethod
    def define_child_window(self, window, locators):
        print(locators)
        return {"guiComponentSetuId" : window.define_child_window(GuiElementMetaData.createEMD(locators)).setu_id}


Following Frame method:
    @classmethod
    def define_frame(cls, dom_root, locators):
        return {"guiComponentSetuId" : dom_root.create_frame(GuiElementMetaData.createEMD(locators)).setu_id}
