Here:
Step 1 passes
Step 2 errs
Step 3 fails

We are using the SOFT validator WITH EXPLICIT EVALUATION within the test after step 2.

Execution never reaches Step 3.

So, test is reported with ERROR result because of step error in step 2.

You can call evaluate any number of times in a test function.
