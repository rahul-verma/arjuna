Here:
Step 1 passes
Step 2 errs
Step 3 fails

We are using the SOFT validator.

So once Step 2 errs, execution of test DOES NOT stop. Step 3 is also executed.

Once test is finished, Arjuna evaluates the steps.

For Step 1 - no issue is reported.
For Step 2 - an error issue is reported.
For Step 3 - a failure issue is reported.

Test itself can be associated with only one primary issue id in Arjuna. 

Here multiple issues exist, so Arjuna chooses to attach the FIRST failure issue id and hence reports
the test with a failure status, although both the issues can be found in issues reported and the 
corresponding steps are also reported with failure and error status respectively.

In this case, failure existed for Step 3.

def test_soft_validator_without_explicit_evaluation(my):
    # Replace validate() call with soft_validate call
    validator = my.steps.soft_validate("Higher purpose")
    validator.assert_that(True).is_true()  # Step 1
    validator.assert_that(None).is_false()  # Step 2
    my.steps.failed("Dummy failure")  # Step 3

    # In this case step 2 causes an error, execution still proceeds because of soft validator. Issue is reported.
    # Step 3 causes an failure, which is captured by Arjuna and reported as an issue.
    # As Failure status takes precendence over error status, test result is reported as failure.

Here:
Step 1 passes
Step 2 errs
Step 3 fails

We are using the SOFT validator WITH EXPLICIT EVALUATION within the test after step 2.

Execution never reaches Step 3.

So, test is reported with ERROR result because of step error in step 2.

You can call evaluate any number of times in a test function.
