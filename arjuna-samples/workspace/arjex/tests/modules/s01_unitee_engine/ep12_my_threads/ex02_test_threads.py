Test is an instance of a test function. Data driven tests 
Decorating with data-driven keywords, creates such instances. E.g. here 12 test would be created using data function.
The 12 tests would be executed using a pool of 5 threads.
For you to observer, thread name is printed.
It is of the format: st-<num>::g-<num>::gs-<num>::m-<num>::ms-<num>::f-<num>::t-<num>
Pay attention to the names. You would find while other sections remain same, the t-<num> is seen from t-1 to t-5
