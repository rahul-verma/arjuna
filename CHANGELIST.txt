Following is the list of critical additions and updates for a given released version:

0.9.6
-----
- Localizer
    - Added built-in support for JSON based localization.
    - Excel and JSON Localizers are automatically loaded and merged into a single Contextual Data Reference
    - Change `ArjunaOption.LOCALE` to `ArjunaOption.L10_LOCALE`.
    - Added `ArjunaOption.L10_STRICT` property. By default it is set to False. It means for references with no localization data, no error is raised and reference itself is returned by `L` function.
    - bucket can be provided as an argument or as a prefix `bucket.`
- Json class
    - Added Json class with jsonpath support.
    - Added jsonpath-rw and jsonpath-rw-ext as dependencies.
- Easy Aliases (L/R/C)
    - The `L` function is alias for Arjuna.get_localized_str.
    - The `C` function is alias for Arjuna.get_config_value.
    - The `R` function is alias for Arjuna.get_dataref_value
- Config Simplification
    - Arjuna automatically looks up Arjuna options and then user options for a name. This does away with the need for `config.arjuna_options.value` and `config.user_options.value`. Relaced with `config.value` call.
    - New config creation made simpler. RunContext is now an internal concept.
    - Docs updated.
    - . and [] retrieval mechanisms added to config object. For a given name, one can use `config.name` or `config[name]` or config.value(name)` calls interchangeably.
    - All arjuna options and user options become automatically available with . and [] lookup.
    - Arjuna.get_config gives reference config by default. If conf name is passed, then that named config object is returned.
    - The `C` function supports config query format i.e. a.b.c will attempt to treat `a` as a configuration name.
    - Many ArjunaOptions have been renamed to simpler, shorter names.
- request object enhanced
    - request.config is by default set to reference config at the top level. Can be retrieved at any child layer.
    - request.get_config without name as argument is same as request.config
    - request.get_config(name) gets any configuration registered with that name from anywhere in the run including environment configurations.
- RunContext and ConfigCreator Concept
    - RunContext as a concept is deprecated.
    - _ConfigCreator Name changed to ConfigBuilder
    - ConfigBuilder is directly associated with a Config object, which is automatically treated as the source/parent config.
    - One can not create a configuration with same name again.
    - Builder has the provision to add config options from any conf file which has arjunaOptions and/or userOptions
    - creator.register without a name creates a unique config name using uuid4. As it returns the config object it has its use case when direct dealing with config object is needed.
    - create.register(name) is useful if the name is to be controlled and used by test author.
- Configuration Layer-wise auto-update:
    - Reference Config is updated as per following sequence:
        - Arjuna central config
        - Project conf
        - Named env conf if provided
        - Run Conf if provided
        - CLI Options
    - Any new custom configuration is updated as per following sequence:
        - Parent Conf (by default it is the Reference Configuration)
        - Programmatic additions
        - Named env conf if provided
        - Run Conf if provided
        - CLI Options
- Data References
    - Arjuna.get_dataref_value method added for easy and simplified value retrieval for a context from a data reference.
    - Simple query format created. Query can be a refname or context.refname or bucket.context.refname.
- Environment Config
    - Any number of configurations for named environments can be created.
    - The configurations are loaded by Arjuna automatically.
    - Programmatically any config can be referred any time.
    - One can provide --run-env CLI switch which picks up the env config. This superimposes this env config on the reference config itself.
    - Doc added.
- New CLI Configuration Switches
    - Added -ao/--arjuna-option and -uo/--user-option. These switches can be supplied multiple times to add any number of Arjuna options or user options. These will override all options set by any other means in Arjuna.
    - --run-env switch as mentioned above.
    - --run-conf: Any configuration file's absolute path can be provided. This is is superimposed on the reference config.
- Example projects and Docs
    - All example code and projects verified.
    - Split the core project into arjuna_start, arjuna_config, arjuna_data and arjuna_l10 projects.
    - Reorganized docs into smaller, focused contents.

0.9.5
-----
- Data References
    - Introduced concept of Contextual Data References.
    - Built-in Support for Column and Row Excel Data References.
    - The Excel data references are automatically loaded by Arjuna during init().
    - The references are easily accessible using the `request` object in test/fixture functions.
    - Added example code and doc.
- Localizer
    - Introduced concept of localization
    - Built-in support for Excel based localization files
    - Excel localizers are automatically loaded and merged into a single Contextual Data Reference

    - Introduced `Locale` enum and ArjunaOption.LOCALE to control configured Locale.
- Chrome driver creation uses the Service object as the previous signature was deprecated.
- Arjuna uses sys.exit with the same code as returned by pytest.main

0.9.4
-----

- BrowserConditions class added with DocumentReadyState condition automatically called for browser methods.

0.9.1
------
- In test or test scope fixture, item can be added to module scope.
- GNS default format changed to YAML. Added PyYAML to setup.py as dependency.
- root and anchor element checking refer to existing element labels. Avoids duplicating same locator information.
- Introduction of "withx" (With Extended) in GNS for cleaner identifiers which share same pattern.
- Added mimesis as a dependency in setup.py. Arjuna will use its facilties for faking/generating commonly used data.
- Introduction of basic Data Generator wrapper class on top of Mimesis.
- Value class is an overhang of Java version of Arjuna. It is completely removed from Arjuna as object wrapper.
    - DataRecord or Configuration values are not Value objects any more.
    - Value class remains to provide any conversion class methods, which can be a useful feature to retain.
- Added SourceNode class. 
    - element.source.node gives an object of this. 
    - Provides finder methods for directly finding content in element source rather than browser based selenium commands.
    - Added xfinder in arjuna.core.xml to define finding strategy.
- Singular names for all directories.
- config.get_arjuna_option_value and config.get_user_option_value -> config.arjuna_options.value, config.user_options.value

0.8.17
------
- Widget class renamed to Section. Widget and Dialog are synonyms for Section.
- Concept of my is removed. pytest does not allow multi-scope fixtures. request fixture is used the same way in fixtures and tests now.
- For data driven test, one needs add 'data' as an arg to the test.
- Common fixtures can be placed in lib.fixtures.
- HTML report screenshots related changes:
    - add_screenshot_for_failed_result now add_screenshot_for_result
    - Behavior can be controlled by passing ignore_passed (on by default) or ignore_fixtures (off by default) arguments.
    - Expects a screen_shooter in Function or Module space. Any object with take_screenshot(prefix) is a screen shooter. 
    - Usage is very simple. Include the following in conftest.py:
        @pytest.mark.hookwrapper
        def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
            result = yield
            PytestHooks.add_screenshot_for_result(item, result)
    - Screenshots are now taken for failures in fixtures as well. Arjuna now does not depend on presence of request fixture in item.funcargs.

0.8.16
------
- Fixed name typo and arg bug in browser api.
- GuiMultiElement gives interface just like GuiElement for source inquiry.
- GuiMultiElement has many assertions available now: assert_size, assert_min_size, assert_max_size, assert_empty, assert_not_empty
- Asserter methods have simpler interface. Goal now is to add higher level assertions in objects themselves.

0.8.15
------
- Introduce __state__ special label in GNS. This element can be automatically checked as a part of Gui Loading Protocol. Avoids the need for writing a validate_readiness method for simple single element loading need.
- Module space bug fix.

0.8.14
------
Minor - Doc links in main README.md made absolute because for PyPi.

0.8.13
------
- Added arjex_internals examples project to create example code that reflects/tests internal workings of Arjuna.
- CLI changes based on community discussion
    - c/consider prefix changed to i/include
    - i/ignore prefix changed to e/exclude
    - --enumerate-only change to --dry-run
- My.repr method is used for including test data in test name. No more of the staple 'my0' in the names.
- Fix in PyTestHooks. Still need to look for a better solution. request object is not retrievable when error happens in fixture.
- To support nested element finding across all With locators that use XPath, "." is automatically pre-fixed if not present.
- New named exceptions introduced for better information: GuiNotLoadedError, GuiLabelNotPresentError, GuiNamespaceLoadingError
- Concept of root element introduced for Widget. 
    - Widget takes a keyword argument 'root_element_locators' in its __init__method.
    - You can specify a single locator (With object) or a list of locators.
    - You can also specifiy it in corresponding GNS file with a special label: __root__
    - If both are specified, then one passed in init overrides the GNS entry.
    - If root element is specified in any of the above manner, it is used to find elements when factory methods of Widget are used (e.g. .element())
    - If root element is NOT specified, automator is used as the finder.
- Test Object Space (earlier called Shared Spaces)
    - my.modules_shared_space is changed to my.module.space for better code structure.
    - request.space in test refers to the current test's scope.
    - In fixtures, request.space refers to the scope as per the fixture scope.
    - With request.space, and request.space, storing is done for scope, retrieval is from current test object up the parent chain.

0.8.12
------
- arjuna_launcher.py moved to scripts directory and updated to support new structure.
- archives directory is not created now.

        - App Model
        - App-Page Object Model
        - App-Page-Widget Object Model
- Added 'fail', 'assert_not_equal', 'assert_true', 'assert_false methods to Asserter.
- Dropdown bug fix as per With.tag instead of With.tag_name
- Name changes for consistency:
    ns_dir -> gns_dir
    def_file_name -> gns_file_name
- Formalized Gui Loading Model and implemented GuiConditions, GuiReady condition and GuiNotLoadedError exception.


0.8.11
------

- With.meta -> changed to With.label
- Fix for GNS for attr based identification.
- Support for static RunID when --static-rid switch is passed. Useful during script development. Default is dynamic timestamped runid.
