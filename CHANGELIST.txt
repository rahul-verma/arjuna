        - Coded - Added at App/Page level.
        - GNS Support added - Can provide label from same GNS file.
        - Coded - widget call can be used to provide as relationship rather than existing element.
        - GNS supports chain of relation: label1 -> label2 -> label3
        - When multiple locators are provided with an OR relationship, relations are applied to each one of them.
        - In GNS the relationship labels can contain Arjuna placeholders and then the parent label can be formaated as usual using gns.formatter call.
        - Nested element finding falls back to direct finding with WebDriver as JS execution support exists only at driver level in Selenium.
    - with.JS and With.Point is supported at element level, however it does not do nested element finding, rather uses driver itself.
    - The fallback mechanism for JS, Point and Relative locators has been added so that such locators can be defined without issues in GNS files or coded GuiSections which have root element set for them.
    - 'pos' meta key in widget meta data:
        - Supported in coded as well GNS format.
        - Supported in nested element finding.

        - Added provision for dot_text which converts to . instead of text() for for specified text. It can also be specified as .text.
        - tags support is added to define multiple tags which are treated as a relative sequence of tags. Either tag or tags should be used. tags can take a single tag, multiple space separated tags as well as a list of tag strings.
        - classes support is added to define one or more classes as string or sequence. 
    - tag locator changed to tags
        - Is converted to CSS selectors
        - The tags can be provided as space separated tags string or sequnce of tag strings.
        - When more than one tag is supplied, the sequnce is assumed to be a descendant sequence (not immediate children)
    - Docs updated and improved for locators.

1.1.22
------
    - Support for 'node' as a valid selector (with type)
        - Can be used programmatically in calls e.g. element(node=node(**kwargs))
        - If the names of attrs conflict with python keywords (e.g. for), you can also provide an 'attrs' dict: element(node=node(a=b, attrs={'c' : 'd'}))
        - The values in attrs dict are overriden by the direct kv paris supplied in node call.
        - 'tag' is a special key and represents the tag name of the node and is not treated as an attribute.
        - 'text' is a special key and represents the text content of the node and is used for matching.
        - node represents partial match for attribute contents, bnode partial match at beginning of attributes contents and fnode represents full content of node attributes.
        - There is an AND relationship among all attribute values supplied.
        - You can use formatters to format the '$$' placeholders within keys and values of node, bnode and fnode.
        - These selectors can be used in GNS files just like other selectors.
    - Updates in Attribute related locators.
        - Change in the way attr, fattr are specified in code and GNS. Breaks current usage.
        - Rather than name and value arguments, direct value will be supplied as key value pair.
        - Specifying tag in the definition will not be supported.
        - node selectors will support tag and multiple attributes to bridge this gap and provide more advanced functionality.
        - battr, eattr support
        - attr related locators are converted to CSS Selectors instead of XPath.
    - Withx Enhancements
        - Withx can be used to define custom locators using node, bnode and fnode. Placeholders and kwargs work for attr names as well as values.
        - Withx supports $$ placeholders like normal GNS.
        - Withx suports C,L,R placeholders.
    - Name changes: Attr -> attr, NVPairs -> nvpairs

1.0.0
-----
- Docs added for:
    - Test Functions
    - Test Resources
    - Test Sessions, Stages and Groups
- PytestHooks made a private API.


0.9.26
------
- New CLI switches -ip, -ep for package based selection added.
- Support for ir (inclusion rules) and er (exclusion rules)
    - Exclusion rules are evaluated. If a test function meets any of the rules, it is removed from collection.
    - If the test function meeting any of the inclusion rules, it is included in the collection.
    - --rule changed to -ir and -er to add provision for include and exclude rules via CLI. Used for magic group creation.
    - ir and er sections can be added in a group definition in groups.yaml file.
    - Internally, the ip/ep/im/em/it/et are converted to to ir/er rules. This means Arjuna is not using pytest markers for test selection. All selection is done based on Arjuna rule set.
    - There is an AND condition between package, module and test rules.
    - PytestHooks.select_tests hook created to select tests based on Arjuna rules. Called in `pytest_collection_modifyitems` pytest hook in conftest.py.
    - Rules are also supported for user defined attributes.
- New symbols for rule creation:
    - For string targets:  !~= for does not match and !*= does not partially match.
- Arjuna built-in `group` fixture is now a default fixture. Group information is directly available in `request.group`. `request.group.space` can be used to store any objects.
- GuiApp's GuiNamespace acts a common namespace across pages, sections and dialogs.
- FIX: --dry-run switch.
- All run options work with the rule-based approach.
- Support for minimalistic project structure for simple use of Arjuna. 
- Test Fixtures --> Referred as Test Resources. Have an option setting as default using `default` keyword argument.
- Support for `xfail` and `skip` keyword arguments in `@test` decorator. `xfail()` and `skip()` helper functions added.
- New Exceptions:
    - TestDecoratorError
    - TestSessionsFileNotFoundError
    - TestStagesFileNotFoundError
    - TestGroupsFileNotFoundError

0.9.25
------
- Selection Rules:
    - Added Selection grammar for info, tags and boolean info types.
    - Each rule can return True/False for an object which has these containers.
- Test function default info, tags, bugs, envs get created for inquiry using `request`.
- Fix in updating options from non-default `env` entry in envs.yaml.
- Fix to allow a user option name as an Enum constant.
- Fix in auto screenshot in case of failure in HTML report.

0.9.24
------
- Critical Fixes:
    - dry_run and report format CLI defaults.
- create-project command changed and fixed as per new project structure for config yamls.
- CLI Updates
    - Logging switches -dl and -ll moved inside the commands.
    - -o and --dray-run show the allowed enum constants as choices.
- Doc updates:
    - CLI doc.
    - Configuration doc.
    - Test Project doc.


0.9.23
------
- Test Groups
    - are defined in groups.yaml file.
    - A group can be run from the command line.
- Test Stages 
    - are defined in stages.yaml file.
    - use **include:** and provide list of group names.
    - A stage can be run from command line.
- Test Sessions 
    - are defined in sessions.yaml file.
    - use **include:** and provide list of stage names.
    - A session can be run from command line.
- CLI enhancements:
    - **run-stage** command added. Using it you can directly run a defined test stage.
    - **run-group** command added. Using it you can directly run a defined test group.
- New Named Exceptions:
    - UndefinedTestStageError, InvalidTestStageDefError
    - UndefinedTestGroupError
- CLI update
    -o, -im, -em, -it, -et switches changed from plural switches expecting nargs to multi-switch method. This means these switches are single-arg switches and can be used in command line any number of times.


0.9.22
------
- Moved all types of configurations to YAML.
- Simplified internal configuration process.
- Single file for each of the following:
    - Data configurations
    - Environment Configurations
    - Session Configurations
- New Named Exceptions:
    - UndefinedTestSessionError
    - InvalidTestSessionDefError

0.9.21
------
- Data Conf and  Env conf concepts updated
    - In a test project, you can define any number of data confs and/or env confs. These are auto-loaded.
    - The configuration name for them are the file names (minus the .conf extension.)
    - Arjuna looks for data.conf and env.conf and updates the reference configuration, if these files exist.
    - Arjuna also generates confs for all combinations of run confs and env confs when it loads. For each combination:
        - Ref config is taken as base
        - data conf is superimposed
        - env conf is superimposed
        - CLI options are superimposed
    - The config name is set to **runconfname_envconfname** e.g. **data1_env1**.
    - The name can be used in the **magic C function** query or as the cname argument.
- Fixtures now allow drive_with argument.
- **-c** / **--conf** switch added. It becomes the conf object mapped to conf.
- Arjuna Session, Stage and Test Grouping concept added:
    - run-project and run-selected represent a default session, stage and group as per the CLI switches. It always executes in a single thread.
    - Built-in fixture **group** can be included in a test signature or fixture signature. It yields group parameters including name of group, thread name and configuration.
    - pytest_generate_tests hook added to test project conftest.py, its Arjuna template and added PytestHooks.configure_group_for_test
        - Auto-parameteries "group" built-in Arjuna fixture. The fixture can be added to a test function signature or any of its fixtures. Configuration passed with -c switch is used to parameterize the **group** fixture mentioned above.
        - It is optional to use this fixture. However, if group related information (e.g. thread name, group name) is needed run time in fixture functions and test functions, then it can be used.
    - run-session switch added to run a named session.
    - Basic session.yaml support added. Supports stages and groups.
        - A session can have multiple stages.
        - Stages are always executed sequentially.
        - A stage can have any number of groups.
        - Stage can have groups run in parallel with its threads setting. Default is 1.
        - A group has a unqiue and it defines pickers. It also can have a conf associated with it.
        - Each group is run in a thread.
        - If conf is defined for a group, the reference configuration is changed to this conf for this group run.
        - Each group is reported separately in a .html and .xml file.
- Dry Run Major enhancement
    - Not a boolen switch any more
    - Takes SHOW_TESTS/SHOW_PLAN/RUN_FIXTURES arguments.
- Arjuna Hooks concept added
    - **hook** directory in project root directory will contain various Arjuna hook modules and corresponding hook calls.
    - **arjuna_config.py** is the name for configuration hooks.
        - **register_configs(configurator)** is the first Arjuna hook created
        - One can programmatically register any number of configurations by taking existing or these newly created configuration objects as basis.
        - The hook is executed before sessions file is processed or test execution starts for a non-session run.
        - The configurations created here can be used with -c / --conf command line switch. They can also be used as group config in session files. 
- CLI Changes: CLI interface heavily updated for simpler names of switches along with more information in help.

0.9.20
------
- Implemented ScreenShooter protocol. Created ScreenShooter base class. **GuiApp** and **GuiPage** support the protocol in Arjuna.

        - Asserter
        - PytestHooks.enhance_reports
    - @track
    - Json
    - xml: NodeLocator and XmlNode
- Elements in Gui are now referred as widgets (taking a cue from wxPython)
- **template** in GNS is changed to **type** for easy understandability (stands for widget type, default is element.)
- (Internal) Locator Meta Data concept has evolved. It now contains meta data about the widget beyond locating it. Its now referred as Gui Widget Meta Data. Reflected in internal class names, messages and exception names.

0.9.18
------
- Major change in internal packaging to aid in controlled API doc generation.
- License info changed from doc string to line-wise comments.
- Sphinx is now used for docs instead of markdown.
- Integration of docs with readthedocs.org: https://arjuna-taf.readthedocs.io
- Google Doc Style for Python has been identified for Arjuna API documentation.
    - Tried for Configuration, ConfigurationBuilder and logging functions. Works well.


0.9.17
------
- Added **TRACE** level to log. 
    - **log_trace** is a direct call.
    - By default trace messages are not included in display or log.
    - Is configurable from command line, project.conf, --run_env and --run-conf.
- Added support for Contextual Logging
    - All log messages are of **default** context
    - You can mark a log message as belonging to one or more contexts.
    - You can allow contexts by controlling the **ArjunaOption.LOG_ALLOWED_CONTEXTS** which is configurable from command line, project.conf, --run_env and --run-conf.
- Added **track** decorator. 
    - It logs begin with args, finish with return and exceptions for Classes, Methods and Functions.
    - It also supports tracking **@classmethod**s and **@staticmethod**s automatically with class level track or individual track decorating.
    - Properties can be decorated with **track** as well:
        - Class level decorating does not cover properties.
        - Decorating a setter automatically covers the getter.
    - Default log level associating with tracking is **debug**. Can be controlled in each **track** decorator by providing the **level** argument.
- --run-conf can be provided wihtout .conf extension.


0.9.16
------
- Added doc for CLI.
- @for_group fixture support added.

    - gui.contains, gui.element.contains
    - gui.gns.contains(label), gui.gns.label.gns.contains(label), gui.gns.label.contains

0.9.14
------
- Documents updated for a more manageable format instead of tight coupling with example code.
- **WebApp**, **Page**, **Section** class names are changed to **GuiApp**, **GuiPage** and **GuiSection** for future compatibility.

0.9.13
------
- wait_until_absent call supported
    - Can be called with **Gui** as well as **GuiElement** as **.wait_until_absent(**locator_kwargs)**
        - Raises GuiElementForLabelPresentError exception on failure.
    - Can be called with **Gui** as well as **GuiElement** as **.wait_until_absent(**labels)**
        - Raises GuiElementPresentError exception on failure.
- contains call supported

    - Can be called with **Gui** as well as **GuiElement** as **.contains(**locator_kwargs)**
    - Can be called with **Gui** as well as **GuiElement** as **.contains(**labels)**
- FIX: Import bug in emd.py

0.9.12
------
- Added locate/element/multi_element/dropdown/radio_group factories to Gui and element/multi_element factories to GuiElement.
- The factories provide a more Pythonic syntax than using tuples or factories for every locator type in user API.
- withx works with the revised factory methods. One can provide **<withx_name>=Params([arg1=val1, arg2=val2, ... argN=valN])** argument to factory methods for identification.
- Locator and Formatter class added for providing complex identification constructs as a single argument. **.locate** method added to Gui and GuiElement.
- Formatted identifiers
    - Identifiers can contain formatter placeholers with the syntax $xyz$ where xyz is a name which you want to replace with a value.
    - For using formatted identifiers in code, you can use **gui.format(xyz=<value>).element(locator="$xyz$")** syntax.
    - For using formatted identifiers in GNS, you can use **gui.format(xyz=<value>).label** syntax.
    - Auto-loaded placeholder values: (query syntax is same as that for the magic **C**, **R** and **L** functions.)
        - Configuration - Specified as **C.<query>**
        - Contextual Data Reference - Specified as **R.<query>**
        - Localized Strings - Specified as **L.<query>**
- Example code and documentation updates in progress.
- With and WithType are now completely internal to Arjuna.
- XmlSource class added with comprehensive node finding and inquiry support. xfinder name changed to NodeLocator to make it similar to Locator for Gui element finding.


0.9.11
------
- Direct log msg calls added: log_debug, log_info, log_warning, log_error, log_fatal. Implentation method used could be extended for contextual logging in Arjuna in future.
- Introduced GNS class. Gui and nested element access for labels defined in GNS can be done as **gui.gns.label** and **element.gns.label** respectively.
- root and anchor elements code optimized to work with direct reference to original element.
- withx supports attr and fattr with named args support for both name and value arguments.
- basic .locate factory added. Needs to be enhanced to support any advanced non-GNS implementations one might find a need for.
- Typo fixed in CLI help for -im.
- All example code has been moved to a single project **arjex**. Code and docs need a fix.

0.9.10
------
- Externalization of Guis is mandatory for element access. Direct use of With.x not allowed. It's an internal concept now.
- Creation of an App/Page can happen without a corresponding GNS file. The Gui definition will be empty in this case.
- Element Label must be an arjuna name.
- Elements can be directly access using **. (dot)** operator. from aby Gui.
- **template** keyword can be used in GNS files to define non-GuiElement object types.
- All example code updated.
- All docs updated as per the revised features.

0.9.9
-----
- Fix: Handling of Root and Anchor elements in GNS.
- Fix: An Empty Yaml GNS file is NOT a problem.
- Fix: Overlap of named parameters for withx in GNS don't conflict with internal arguments passed by Arjuna.

0.9.8
-----
- Firefox driver uses Service object as per Selenium 4. Chrome was updated to use Service earlier.
- You can now use an existing Driver service URL. ArjunaOption.SELENIUM_SERVICE_URL is used for the purpose. Works with docker-selenium. /wd/hub is appended automatically to the URL.
- Arjuna automatically downloads driver for Chrome/Firefox using webdriver_manager package. Added setup.py dependency. Set to True by default. Can be controlled using ArjunaOption.SELENIUM_DRIVER_DOWNLOAD option.
- Browser headless mode can be controlled with ArjunaOption.BROWSER_HEADLESS option. False by default.
- BrowserName enum has been changed to contain only Chrome and Firefox as these are the current supported browsers.
- withx in GNS files supports string, list and dictionary entries in YAML and maps them to vargs and kwargs in formatting the value of withx entry referred by a label.
- Separated current Yaml parsing as Yaml and YamlFile classes in arjuna.tpi.parser.yaml module.
- Introduced WithX class to handle WithX parsing and processing.
- Provision to add Withx identifiers which can be referred to from any GNS file. These are included in the **<Project Root>/guiauto/withx/withx.yaml** file.
- A WithX identifier defined in **withx.yaml** can be used programmatically. It can be thought of as a method which Arjuna defines at run-time with the signature **With.locator(*args, **kwargs)** and can be called from any part of your code.

0.9.7
-----
Minor update. All l10 references are changed to l10n.

0.9.6
-----
- Localizer
    - Added built-in support for JSON based localization.
    - Excel and JSON Localizers are automatically loaded and merged into a single Contextual Data Reference
    - Change **ArjunaOption.LOCALE** to **ArjunaOption.L10_LOCALE**.
    - Added **ArjunaOption.L10_STRICT** property. By default it is set to False. It means for references with no localization data, no error is raised and reference itself is returned by **L** function.
    - bucket can be provided as an argument or as a prefix **bucket.**
- Json class
    - Added Json class with jsonpath support.
    - Added jsonpath-rw and jsonpath-rw-ext as dependencies.
- Easy Aliases (L/R/C)
    - The **L** function is alias for Arjuna.get_localized_str.
    - The **C** function is alias for Arjuna.get_config_value.
    - The **R** function is alias for Arjuna.get_dataref_value
- Config Simplification
    - Arjuna automatically looks up Arjuna options and then user options for a name. This does away with the need for **config.arjuna_options.value** and **config.user_options.value**. Relaced with **config.value** call.
    - New config creation made simpler. RunContext is now an internal concept.
    - Docs updated.
    - . and [] retrieval mechanisms added to config object. For a given name, one can use **config.name** or **config[name]** or config.value(name)** calls interchangeably.
    - All arjuna options and user options become automatically available with . and [] lookup.
    - Arjuna.get_config gives reference config by default. If conf name is passed, then that named config object is returned.
    - The **C** function supports config query format i.e. a.b.c will attempt to treat **a** as a configuration name.
    - Many ArjunaOptions have been renamed to simpler, shorter names.
- request object enhanced
    - request.config is by default set to reference config at the top level. Can be retrieved at any child layer.
    - request.get_config without name as argument is same as request.config
    - request.get_config(name) gets any configuration registered with that name from anywhere in the run including environment configurations.
- RunContext and ConfigCreator Concept
    - RunContext as a concept is deprecated.
    - _ConfigCreator Name changed to ConfigBuilder
    - ConfigBuilder is directly associated with a Config object, which is automatically treated as the source/parent config.
    - One can not create a configuration with same name again.
    - Builder has the provision to add config options from any conf file which has arjuna_options and/or user_options
    - creator.register without a name creates a unique config name using uuid4. As it returns the config object it has its use case when direct dealing with config object is needed.
    - create.register(name) is useful if the name is to be controlled and used by test author.
- Configuration Layer-wise auto-update:
    - Reference Config is updated as per following sequence:
        - Arjuna central config
        - Project conf
        - Named env conf if provided
        - Run Conf if provided
        - CLI Options
    - Any new custom configuration is updated as per following sequence:
        - Parent Conf (by default it is the Reference Configuration)
        - Programmatic additions
        - Named env conf if provided
        - Run Conf if provided
        - CLI Options
- Data References
    - Arjuna.get_dataref_value method added for easy and simplified value retrieval for a context from a data reference.
    - Simple query format created. Query can be a refname or context.refname or bucket.context.refname.
- Environment Config
    - Any number of configurations for named environments can be created.
    - The configurations are loaded by Arjuna automatically.
    - Programmatically any config can be referred any time.
    - One can provide --run-env CLI switch which picks up the env config. This superimposes this env config on the reference config itself.
    - Doc added.
- New CLI Configuration Switches
    - Added -ao/--arjuna-option and -uo/--user-option. These switches can be supplied multiple times to add any number of Arjuna options or user options. These will override all options set by any other means in Arjuna.
    - --run-env switch as mentioned above.
    - --run-conf: Any configuration file's absolute path can be provided. This is is superimposed on the reference config.
- Example projects and Docs
    - All example code and projects verified.
    - Split the core project into arjuna_start, arjuna_config, arjuna_data and arjuna_l10 projects.
    - Reorganized docs into smaller, focused contents.

0.9.5
-----
- Data References
    - Introduced concept of Contextual Data References.
    - Built-in Support for Column and Row Excel Data References.
    - The Excel data references are automatically loaded by Arjuna during init().
    - The references are easily accessible using the **request** object in test/fixture functions.
    - Added example code and doc.
- Localizer
    - Introduced concept of localization
    - Built-in support for Excel based localization files

    - The **L** function is a special function to easily localize a string as per **Locale**.
    - Introduced **Locale** enum and ArjunaOption.LOCALE to control configured Locale.
- Chrome driver creation uses the Service object as the previous signature was deprecated.
- Arjuna uses sys.exit with the same code as returned by pytest.main

0.9.4
-----
- create-project command added to CLI.

- Fixed example codes across projects.
- Data Driven Testing
    - Fixed indexed values in Data Record.
    - Data Record keys/names are now case-insensitive.
    - Support for **records** markup.
    - Support for **data_function** markup.
    - Support for **data_class** markup.
    - Support for **data_file** markup (Out of the box support for XLS, TSV/CSV and INI formats.)
    - Support for record filtering in data files.
    - Support for **many_data_sources** builder.
    - Added example code and docs for data driven testing.

0.9.3
-----
- Added Linux to enum.

0.9.2
-----
- Bug fix: attr and related With factory methods had a bug post refactoring. Fixed.
- Bug fix: screenshot path in HTML report hook.
- Entity -> DataEntity for clarity of purpose.
- BrowserConditions class added with DocumentReadyState condition automatically called for browser methods.

0.9.1
------
- In test or test scope fixture, item can be added to module scope.
- GNS default format changed to YAML. Added PyYAML to setup.py as dependency.
- root and anchor element checking refer to existing element labels. Avoids duplicating same locator information.
- Introduction of "withx" (With Extended) in GNS for cleaner identifiers which share same pattern.
- Added mimesis as a dependency in setup.py. Arjuna will use its facilties for faking/generating commonly used data.
- Introduction of basic Data Generator wrapper class on top of Mimesis.
- Value class is an overhang of Java version of Arjuna. It is completely removed from Arjuna as object wrapper.
    - DataRecord or Configuration values are not Value objects any more.
    - Value class remains to provide any conversion class methods, which can be a useful feature to retain.
- Added SourceNode class. 
    - element.source.node gives an object of this. 
    - Provides finder methods for directly finding content in element source rather than browser based selenium commands.
    - Added xfinder in arjuna.tpi.helper.xml to define finding strategy.
- Singular names for all directories.
- config.get_arjuna_option_value and config.get_user_option_value -> config.arjuna_options.value, config.user_options.value

0.8.17
------
- Widget class renamed to GuiSection. Widget and Dialog are synonyms for GuiSection.
- Concept of my is removed. pytest does not allow multi-scope fixtures. request fixture is used the same way in fixtures and tests now.
- For data driven test, one needs add 'data' as an arg to the test.
- Common fixtures can be placed in lib.fixtures.
- HTML report screenshots related changes:
    - add_screenshot_for_failed_result now enhance_reports
    - Behavior can be controlled by passing ignore_passed (on by default) or ignore_fixtures (off by default) arguments.
    - Expects a screen_shooter in Function or Module space. Any object with take_screenshot(prefix) is a screen shooter. 
    - Usage is very simple. Include the following in conftest.py:
        @pytest.mark.hookwrapper
        def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
            result = yield
            PytestHooks.enhance_reports(item, result)
    - Screenshots are now taken for failures in fixtures as well. Arjuna now does not depend on presence of request fixture in item.funcargs.

0.8.16
------
- Fixed name typo and arg bug in browser api.
- GuiMultiElement gives interface just like GuiElement for source inquiry.
- GuiMultiElement has many assertions available now: assert_size, assert_min_size, assert_max_size, assert_empty, assert_not_empty
- Asserter methods have simpler interface. Goal now is to add higher level assertions in objects themselves.

0.8.15
------
- Introduce __state__ special label in GNS. This element can be automatically checked as a part of Gui Loading Protocol. Avoids the need for writing a validate_readiness method for simple single element loading need.
- Module space bug fix.

0.8.14
------
Minor - Doc links in main README.md made absolute because for PyPi.

0.8.13
------
- Added arjex_internals examples project to create example code that reflects/tests internal workings of Arjuna.
- CLI changes based on community discussion
    - c/consider prefix changed to i/include
    - i/ignore prefix changed to e/exclude
    - --enumerate-only change to --dry-run
- My.repr method is used for including test data in test name. No more of the staple 'my0' in the names.
- Fix in PyTestHooks. Still need to look for a better solution. request object is not retrievable when error happens in fixture.
- To support nested element finding across all With locators that use XPath, "." is automatically pre-fixed if not present.
- New named exceptions introduced for better information: GuiNotLoadedError, GuiLabelNotPresentError, GuiNamespaceLoadingError
- Concept of root element introduced for Widget. 
    - Widget takes a keyword argument 'root_element_locators' in its __init__method.
    - You can specify a single locator (With object) or a list of locators.
    - You can also specifiy it in corresponding GNS file with a special label: __root__
    - If both are specified, then one passed in init overrides the GNS entry.
    - If root element is specified in any of the above manner, it is used to find elements when factory methods of Widget are used (e.g. .element())
    - If root element is NOT specified, automator is used as the finder.
- Test Object Space (earlier called Shared Spaces)
    - my.modules_shared_space is changed to my.module.space for better code structure.
    - request.space in test refers to the current test's scope.
    - In fixtures, request.space refers to the scope as per the fixture scope.
    - With request.space, and request.space, storing is done for scope, retrieval is from current test object up the parent chain.

0.8.12
------
- arjuna_launcher.py moved to scripts directory and updated to support new structure.
- archives directory is not created now.
- Cleanup of arjuna central conf and description files.

0.8.11
------

- With.meta -> changed to With.label
- Fix for GNS for attr based identification.
- Support for static RunID when --static-rid switch is passed. Useful during script development. Default is dynamic timestamped runid.


0.8.10
------
Primary Goal: Document Usage of Key Features. Make code changes to support doc flow and intuitive names/usage.

- Added asserter object to 'my'
- Split Example Project to represent documentation sections.
- Examples are now tracked based on transformation to @test and doc written.
- Examples:
    - Core Features
        - Writing First Test
        - Value abstraction
        - Configuration - Arjuna Options and User Defined Options
    - Web UI Automation Basics
        - Getting Started with WebApp
        - GuiElement - Selenium By's Equivalent, Arjuna Extensions, Basic Interactions
        - Creating a Self-Contained App Class
        - GuiMultiElement
- Added non-coding documentation:
    - Project Structure
- CLI Changes
    - cm/im switches removed based on new test structure.
    - cf/if changed to ct/it (--consider-tests, --ignore-tests).
    - run-pickers changed to run-selected.
- Simplification of With
    - class_name, class_names, compound_class -> With.classes
    - css_selector -> selector
    - tag_name -> tag
    - link_text -> flink (Full text of link)
    - link_ptext -> link (Default match in Arjuna is Partial)
    - javascript -> js
    - attr_value -> fattr (Full attribute)
    - attr_pvalue -> attr (Default match in Arjuna is Partial)
- WebApp Interface Improvements
    - delegates all calls which it does not contain to its 'ui' obj. It simplifies the App abstraction code in tests.
    - title is a direct inquirable attribute
    - go_to_url is a direct call.
- Name and importing changes
    - AnyRefValue changed to Value. It is now a direct arjuna import.
    - DefaultTestContext -> RunContext
    - guiauto_max_wait property method -> guiauto_max_wait
- With.attr* now take two arguments and simple strings rather than [attr][value] string.
- test.my and Gui have Arjuna's asserter object. More assertions to be added. AsserterMixIn moved to asserter module.
- Current working directory is changed to project directory before pytest is launched.
- pytest.ini now present inside arjuna deployment.
- conftest.py now resides inside tests directory.
- Basic proof of concept done w.r.t. creating session level fixtures outside of conftest. Will build on this in upcoming versions.

-----
- (Critical Fix) Support for @test decorator withour any args for simple tests.
- Support for module level shared space.

0.8.8
-----
- _wait_until_element_absent method support in Gui.
- Element filtering support for multi-element. (Example 34).

- Support for browser level screenshot.
- Support for automatic screenshot on failure in test and inclusion in HTML report.
- Support for -cm -im -cc -ic -cf -if test filtering switches added.
- Support for -e --enumerate-only switch added to check display picked tests without running.
- Added @test decorator for Arjuna test function.
- Added support for defining dependencies by provide id and exclude_if args to @test
- Data Driven Testing support using drive_with argument to @test
- Support for a single data record source using record argument.
- Added support for data store, shared objects and basic data pipeline.
- Support for 'my' as a single argument containing info and data about test func.
- Support for module level and test level fixtures using @for_module and @for_test decorators.
- Support for lookup of a resource in the the reverse order of function, class, module and session.
- Fixtures take request as arg. Tests take my and request as args.
- Dictionary as well . supported for setting and retrieval of resources.

0.8.7
-----
- Arjuna now uses pytest as its engine instead of unittest. It supports unittest style tests as well.
- Added pytest and pytest-html as dependencies in setup.py.

- Logging functionality is fixed. Extraneous logs removed.
- CLI: Support for -dl (console display level) and -ll (log level) CLI switches.
- Log and screenshots directory is within Run report directory for a run id.
- RunID is clubbed with timestamp to form the final run id to avoid any overwriting of reports.

0.8.6
