Following is the list of critical additions and updates for a given released version:

0.8.14
------
Minor - Doc links in main README.md made abolsute because for PyPi.

0.8.13
------
- Added arjex_internals examples project to create example code that reflects/tests internal workings of Arjuna.
- CLI changes based on community discussion
    - c/consider prefix changed to i/include
    - i/ignore prefix changed to e/exclude
    - --enumerate-only change to --dry-run
- My.repr method is used for including test data in test name. No more of the staple 'my0' in the names.
- Fix in PyTestHooks. Still need to look for a better solution. request object is not retrievable when error happens in fixture.
- To support nested element finding across all With locators that use XPath, "." is automatically pre-fixed if not present.
- New named exceptions introduced for better information: GuiNotLoadedError, GuiLabelNotPresentError, GuiNamespaceLoadingError
- Concept of root element introduced for Widget. 
    - Widget takes a keyword argument 'root_element_locators' in its __init__method.
    - You can specify a single locator (With object) or a list of locators.
    - You can also specifiy it in corresponding GNS file with a special label: __root__
    - If both are specified, then one passed in init overrides the GNS entry.
    - If root element is specified in any of the above manner, it is used to find elements when factory methods of Widget are used (e.g. .element())
    - If root element is NOT specified, automator is used as the finder.
- Test Object Space (earlier called Shared Spaces)
    - my.modules_shared_space is changed to my.module.store for better code structure.
    - my.store in test refers to the current test's scope.
    - In fixtures, request.store refers to the scope as per the fixture scope.
    - With my.store, and request.store, storing is done for scope, retrieval is from current test object up the parent chain.

0.8.12
------
- arjuna_launcher.py moved to scripts directory and updated to support new structure.

        - Gui Loading Logic
        - App Model
        - App-Page Object Model
        - App-Page-Widget Object Model
- Added 'fail', 'assert_not_equal', 'assert_true', 'assert_false methods to Asserter.
- Dropdown bug fix as per With.tag instead of With.tag_name
- Name changes for consistency:
    ns_dir -> gns_dir
    def_file_name -> gns_file_name
- Formalized Gui Loading Model and implemented GuiConditions, GuiReady condition and GuiNotLoadedError exception.


0.8.11
------

- With.meta -> changed to With.label
- Fix for GNS for attr based identification.
- Support for static RunID when --static-rid switch is passed. Useful during script development. Default is dynamic timestamped runid.


0.8.10
------
Primary Goal: Document Usage of Key Features. Make code changes to support doc flow and intuitive names/usage.

- Added asserter object to 'my'
- Split Example Project to represent documentation sections.
- Examples are now tracked based on transformation to @test and doc written.
- Examples:
    - Core Features
        - Writing First Test
        - Value abstraction
        - Configuration - Arjuna Options and User Defined Options
    - Web UI Automation Basics
        - Getting Started with WebApp
        - GuiElement - Selenium By's Equivalent, Arjuna Extensions, Basic Interactions
        - Creating a Self-Contained App Class
        - GuiMultiElement
- Added non-coding documentation:
    - Project Structure
- CLI Changes
    - cm/im switches removed based on new test structure.
    - cf/if changed to ct/it (--consider-tests, --ignore-tests).
    - run-pickers changed to run-selected.
- Simplification of With
    - class_name, class_names, compound_class -> With.classes
    - css_selector -> selector
    - tag_name -> tag
    - link_text -> flink (Full text of link)
    - link_ptext -> link (Default match in Arjuna is Partial)
    - javascript -> js
    - attr_value -> fattr (Full attribute)
    - attr_pvalue -> attr (Default match in Arjuna is Partial)
- WebApp Interface Improvements
    - delegates all calls which it does not contain to its 'ui' obj. It simplifies the App abstraction code in tests.
    - title is a direct inquirable attribute
    - go_to_url is a direct call.
- Name and importing changes
    - AnyRefValue changed to Value. It is now a direct arjuna import.
    - DefaultTestContext -> RunContext
    - guiauto_max_wait property method -> guiauto_max_wait
- With.attr* now take two arguments and simple strings rather than [attr][value] string.
- test.my and Gui have Arjuna's asserter object. More assertions to be added. AsserterMixin moved to asserter module.
- Current working directory is changed to project directory before pytest is launched.
- pytest.ini now present inside arjuna deployment.
- conftest.py now resides inside tests directory.
- Basic proof of concept done w.r.t. creating session level fixtures outside of conftest. Will build on this in upcoming versions.

0.8.9

- Support for module level shared space.

0.8.8
-----
- wait_until_element_absent method support in Gui.
- Element filtering support for multi-element. (Example 34).
- Support for loadable page and widget via overridable prepare, reach_until and validate_readiness methods.
- Support for browser level screenshot.
- Support for automatic screenshot on failure in test and inclusion in HTML report.
- Support for -cm -im -cc -ic -cf -if test filtering switches added.
- Support for -e --enumerate-only switch added to check display picked tests without running.
- Added @test decorator for Arjuna test function.
- Added support for defining dependencies by provide id and exclude_if args to @test
- Data Driven Testing support using drive_with argument to @test
- Support for a single data record source using record argument.
- Added support for data store, shared objects and basic data pipeline.
- Support for 'my' as a single argument containing info and data about test func.
- Support for module level and test level fixtures using @for_module and @for_test decorators.
- Support for lookup of a resource in the the reverse order of function, class, module and session.
- Fixtures take request as arg. Tests take my and request as args.
- Dictionary as well . supported for setting and retrieval of resources.

0.8.7
-----
- Arjuna now uses pytest as its engine instead of unittest. It supports unittest style tests as well.

- Logging functionality is fixed. Extraneous logs removed.
- CLI: Support for -dl (console display level) and -ll (log level) CLI switches.
- Log and screenshots directory is within Run report directory for a run id.
- RunID is clubbed with timestamp to form the final run id to avoid any overwriting of reports.

0.8.6
